# Crosstalk Demo
This is a simple demonstration of a portion of the Crosstalk system's functionality.
It is a fairly basic JS app which acts like a chat room and runs off a Crosstalk instance.

## Getting started
You'll need an instance of Crosstalk running.

###First, edit app.js.

Find:
```var api = new Crosstalk("http://10.10.0.90:9510/api/", null, CryptoJS, $.session);```
And change `http://10.10.0.90:9510/api/` to whatever the endpoint of your Crosstalk instance is.

Now, open up app.html in a modern browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox
